            I received a job mid-course and the subjects I learned were current,
            if not more so in the company joined I honestly feel I got every
            penny's worth.

            I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I have
            been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had
            some amazing experience here. I signed out for the free intro course
            and found it incredibly fun. I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
            12 weeks was the best - and the most grueling part of my life.Since
            completing the course I have successfully switched careers working
            as a software engineer at VR startup.

            "Before joining the bootcamp, I have never written a line of code.I
            needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
            programming step by step.I was encouraged to enrol by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
            program.The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
            were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.The
            agile team in particular was outstanding. It took my learning to the
            next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. I fact I have
            often referred to it during my interviews as an example of my
            development experience.It certainly helped me land a job as a
            fullstack developer after receiving multiple offers.100%
            recommended."

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
            Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
            easy.

            The staff seems really concerned about my progress which I find
            really refreshing.The program gave me the confidence necessary to go
            out to the world and present myself as a capable junior developer
            the standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention
            you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people
