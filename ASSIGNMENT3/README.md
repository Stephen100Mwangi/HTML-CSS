The second image is a webpage that utilizes the CSS grid property.The CSS grid property `display:grid;`is used to arrange boxes which require complex arrangement. Cells inside a container are arranged as a grid which allows overlapping.The grid property supports arrangement of cells on the X-axis and y-axis through `rows` and `columns`. Columns are normally predetermined. The advantage of flex arrangement is the ability to grow as content increases.Additionally, subsequent boxes increase in height as other sibling boxes increase in height.
